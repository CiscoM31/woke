# woke

`woke` is an inclusive language linter.

It is still very much WIP. More to come...

## Running

```bash
# Run with defaults (see default.yaml for default rules, runs against all files in the working directory)
go run main.go

# Check out the usage
go run main.go --help
```

## For testing the linter

Until I can write proper tests...

Words to avoid:
* Blacklist
* White-list
* whitelist
* blacklist
