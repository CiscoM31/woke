# woke

`woke` is a text file analysis tool that detects non-inclusive language in your source code.

Creating an inclusive work environment is imperitive to a healthy, supportive, and productive culture, and an environment where everyone feels welcome and included.

`woke`'s purpose is to point out places where improvements can be made by removing non-inclusive language and replacing it with more inclusive alternatives.

Companies like [GitHub](https://github.com/github/renaming), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1278733303508418560), and [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1o9zxsxl) are already pushing these changes.
